The year is almost over, and it’s time to take a step back and reflect. In 2024, more than 50 articles were published on this beautiful blog site—most of them inspired by readers who continue to ask questions and suggest new topics.

I want to express my heartfelt thanks for all your kind feedback and thoughtful suggestions.

While we don’t have a new article this week, we’ll take a thematic look back at everything we’ve accomplished in 2024.

Enjoy your time with family and friends, wherever you are! And Merry Christmas to those who celebrate!

See you in January with lots of new, nerdy Peakboard content!

Love,
Michelle
