The long awaited version 4.1 was release in October 2025 - finally. So far no other new version brought so many minor changes and fixes. But it's no the huge number we want to focus on in this week's article. We will focus on the top five huge changes and new features. Let's go!

1. BACnet

BACnet (Building Automation and Control Network) is a open communication protocol designed for building automation systems. It allows devices such as HVAC controllers, lighting systems, access control, and sensors from different manufacturers to communicate and work together. BACnet is widely used in large buildings, factories, and smart infrastructures for centralized monitoring and control of energy systems.

Technically, BACnet defines standardized messages and data structures that are exchanged over the network. The new BACnet data source acts as BACnet client and communicates with the servers / devices.
